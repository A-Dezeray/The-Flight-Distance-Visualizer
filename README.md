# ✈️ Flight Distance Visualizer

An interactive web application that demonstrates the relationship between aircraft wingspan and flight distance through real-time animation and data visualization.

## Overview

The Flight Distance Visualizer was created to bridge the gap between scientific principles learned in natural science coursework and practical software development. This project visualizes how wingspan affects aircraft flight performance using simplified aerodynamic calculations and engaging animations.

## Features

- **Interactive Input**: Enter wingspan values from 1 to 100 meters
- **Real-time Animation**: Watch an animated aircraft fly along its calculated trajectory
- **Scientific Method Sidebar**: Displays the scientific reasoning behind the project
- **Data Visualization**: Shows flight distance, maximum height, and flight time
- **Responsive Design**: Works on various screen sizes
- **Educational Explanations**: Learn about lift, drag, and aerodynamic efficiency

## How It Works

1. Enter a wingspan value in meters
2. Click "Calculate Flight" to run the simulation
3. Watch as the airplane animates along its trajectory path on the chart
4. View detailed results including:
   - Estimated flight distance
   - Maximum height achieved
   - Total flight time

The application uses simplified aerodynamic principles:
- **Lift increases** with larger wingspans (more surface area)
- **Drag decreases** with better wing efficiency
- **Glide ratio** improves, allowing longer flight distances

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5 Canvas**: For rendering the animated chart and aircraft
- **JavaScript (ES6)**: Flight calculations and animation logic
- **CSS3**: Modern styling with gradients and responsive layout
- **No external dependencies**: Pure vanilla JavaScript implementation

## Getting Started

Simply open `index.html` in any modern web browser to start using the application.

No build process, installation, or dependencies required.

## Scientific Principles

This project demonstrates several aerodynamic concepts:

- **Lift Generation**: Larger wingspans create more lift due to increased surface area
- **Lift-to-Drag Ratio**: Better wing design reduces drag and improves efficiency
- **Glide Performance**: Higher efficiency allows aircraft to travel farther

While the calculations are simplified for educational purposes, they reflect real aerodynamic relationships.

## Learning Outcomes

Through building this project, I gained practical experience with:

- Canvas API and animation techniques
- Event handling and user input validation
- Mathematical modeling and physics simulation
- Creating interactive data visualizations
- Writing clean, maintainable JavaScript code
- Connecting scientific concepts to software development

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements could include:
- Additional parameters (weight, angle, wind resistance)
- Multiple aircraft comparisons
- Historical flight data
- More complex aerodynamic models
- Sound effects and enhanced animations
